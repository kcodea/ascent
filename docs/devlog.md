# ASCENT — development log

Newest first. Each entry records **what changed and why**, plus how it was verified. The forward
queue lives in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md); high-level milestones in [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## 2026-06-16

### Combat-feel beats, engine/balance fixes, card-UX pass, repo conventions
- **Combat replay → beats** (`195f2ca`): the replay advances in beats — a primary action (attack /
  Start-of-Combat / summon / buff / reborn) and all the result events it caused (both minions'
  damage, shields, poison, deaths) resolve together. So an attacker and its target take damage at
  the same instant and their floats land together. Dead minions are removed from the board (no grey
  fade): a death from a prior beat is filtered out; the minion dying in the current beat shows for
  one beat then is gone; the result screen shows survivors only.
- **Engine / balance** (`4c29eb4`): embers are uncapped within a turn — selling was clamped to
  `maxEmbers` (== current embers right after the per-turn refill) so it paid nothing at turn start;
  now sell just adds. Keyword grants (Toxin/Plaguebringer) target the highest-attack friend that
  *lacks* the keyword, never wasting the grant. Enemy strength softened for turns 1–4 (ramp 0.30→1.0
  over waves 1–7, width tracks the wave); greedy bot climbs to ~wave 8–10.
- **Card UX** (`dedf1b5` + styles in `195f2ca`): the name now sits as a pill on the bottom of the
  art with the keyword/text area below it (more room for legible text). Removed the result toast bar
  above the Omen. The drag-ghost positions via GPU transform (clean 150ms snap-back instead of a
  juddery left/top animation) with a small follow-lag + tilt for felt weight.
- **Repo conventions**: README carries a Recent-changes + Short-term-roadmap summary; CLAUDE.md gains
  a rule to keep README/devlog/roadmap current each commit, and a rule to ask clarifying questions on
  ambiguous asks. (The private GitHub repo `kcodea/ascent` was created earlier in the day.)

### UI fixes: button layering, no text-select/right-click, cursor + timer behavior (`a2c7b19`)
- **Shop controls layering** — the Refresh/Freeze/Tier/End Turn bar now sits above the tavern cards
  (`position:relative; z-index:6` + 16px clearance, tavern row aligned `flex-start`). The tall 264px
  minion cards had been eclipsing the buttons.
- **No text selection / no right-click** — `user-select:none` on `body`; `contextmenu` preventDefault
  registered in `apps/web/src/main.tsx`.
- **Drag cursor fix** — the closed-fist cursor was stranding "on" after the first drag. `body.dragging`
  is now removed on pointer release in `onUp` (immediate revert), with an effect tied to `drag.active`
  as a safety net. Also restored the gauntlet hover cursor over cards/buttons: a later `cursor:pointer`
  in the base `.card`/`.btn`/`.hero` rules had been overriding the custom-cursor rule once cards
  stopped being native-`draggable`.
- **Timer behavior** — the 30s round timer no longer auto-starts combat at 0; it now locks every
  action **except End Turn** (which pulses). `timeUp` gates `beginDrag`, Refresh/Freeze/Tier, and the
  Hero Power click.
- Verified via DOM: z-index + 9px button/card clearance, `user-select:none`, contextmenu prevented,
  `body.dragging` lifecycle (added during drag, cleared on release), gauntlet cursor resolves.

### Card sizing, tier badge, End Turn, round timer, triple rework, golden doubling, combat slide
- **Fixed 1:1 card size everywhere** (`069072b`) — cards are a constant **190×264** in tavern,
  warband, hand, combat, Discover and the drag-ghost. Recruit cards had been stretching to row height
  (so they shrank when the control bar + bigger panels tightened the layout) while combat cards were
  fixed; this unifies them and also resolves the art-at-50% flex-basis ambiguity.
- **Tier badge** on every card (top-centre, overlapping the top edge); **End Turn** (renamed from
  "Face the Omen") moved next to Tier in the tavern control bar at 2× size.
- **30s round timer** top-centre (`8bb900d`); ring depletes, turns red under 5s.
- **Two-step triple Discover + golden doubling** (`f6b8f8f`) — a triple drops a golden 2× minion into
  hand with *no* immediate Discover. Playing the golden grants a "Glimpse Beyond" Discover spell;
  playing that spell opens the Discover (3 minions from one tier up). Golden minions fire effects at
  doubled magnitude (combat + recruit factories ×2 when golden; card text doubles "+N/+N" and
  "deal N"). New `discoverspell` token; combat `Minion` gained a `golden` flag.
- **Combat slide-to-target** (`d56367b`) — the attacking card physically slides ~62% into its target
  (inline transform from the two units' live positions); damage floats at the clash.
- 62/62 tests; typecheck/lint/build clean throughout.

### Big UX pass (commit-per-feature)
- 1:1 combat cards using the real `Card` component (`dc86952`).
- Hero-Power **targeting line** with a snapping target orb (`b68a02b`).
- **Pointer-drag overhaul** — solid card follows the cursor, snap-back on invalid drop, gold "Sell +1"
  glow over the tavern (`abeb2eb`).
- Custom gauntlet/hand **cursors** (`29b23e0`).
- Hero-sized Ember/Resolve panels + a fanned, hover-pop **hand** (`6e82264`).
- 2× tavern controls above the shop + **center-anchored** warband (`1505981`).
- Terse mechanical card text + **keyword tooltips** + card width +15% (`71a31c5`).

### Content + balance
- **5 tribes per run** + active-tribe HUD (`667677b`).
- **Triples & Discover** v1 (`38bfdcd`) — later reworked to the two-step flow above.
- **Early-game balance on-ramp** (`d9fe8bb`) — enemy width capped near the wave number, stats ramp
  55%→100% over waves 1–5, and a gentler loss-damage formula, so waves 1–3 are winnable. Greedy bot
  now climbs to ~wave 7–9 (was 3–4).
- **Headless balance runner** (`216bc26`, `npm run balance`) — mono-tribe boards vs every threat,
  prints a tribe×threat win-rate matrix + counter-matrix adherence. Flags Mech dominant, Beast weak,
  Dragon/Undead flat, Demon holds.
- **Demon tribe** (`1f03feb`) — recruit-time Consume system (`onConsume` event + reactions).
- **Mech tribe** (`ba4e583`) — Divine-Shield walls + shield-break payoff chain + Magnetic merge.
- UI note batch (`cb1d95e`) — 50% card art, tribe-typed footer, big centred hero, buy/sell/summon FX.

## Earlier — M0 / M1
- **M0** — deterministic engine: seeded mulberry32 RNG, event bus, pure `simulate()` → event log;
  Beasts + neutral glue; headless determinism harness (`npm run harness`).
- **M1** — run-loop reducer + economy + 5 threats + deterministic wave/enemy generation + scoring +
  save/load; recruit-phase effect system (Battlecries / buff-on-buy / summon buffs); Dragons tribe;
  Battlegrounds hand (buy→hand→play→board); live recruit screen (`@game/ui` + `apps/web`); combat
  arena replaying the event log; full playable loop (recruit → combat → next wave / game over).
