/**
 * Parameters for the combat attack lunge (`playAttackLunge` in useCombatReplay.ts). `DEFAULTS` below is what
 * SHIPS; the DEV Lunge tuner may override them for the current tab only (sessionStorage — see the note above
 * `KEY`, which explains why it is no longer localStorage). The lunge reads `getLungeConfig()` at call time.
 *
 * ## Every dial here is a property of the VECTOR, never of a seat
 *
 * The board `.row` is `justify-content: center`, so a 6-card side seats at different x positions than a
 * 7-card side, and the rows RE-CENTER mid-combat as units die. A distinct seating is a (count, index) pair
 * — 28 per side, 784 attacker→defender vectors — and even that undercounts, because the same nominal
 * "slot 3 → slot 5" is a different vector before and after a death reflows the row. There is no stable
 * per-pairing key to hang config on.
 *
 * So the lunge is tuned as FUNCTIONS OF THE APPROACH VECTOR, resolved live from the two rects:
 *   - distance → strike duration (constant px/s via `targetSpeed`, bounded by the clamps)
 *   - distance → strike EASE (three bands, see `strikeEaseFor`) — a curve that reads as a snap over 180ms
 *     reads as a drift-then-lurch over 440ms, so short and long strikes get their own curve
 *   - approach angle → lead tilt (`tiltAngleScale`) — the tilt used to read only `sign(dx)`, so a steep
 *     diagonal led with the same corner as a flat sideways swing
 * If a knob would need to know "which slot", it can't ship. That constraint is the point of this file.
 *
 * Note the windup + strike durations are GSAP seconds (NOT scaled by the beat-clock SPEED). The attack
 * RESULT beat (damage floats / recoil) is timed to land at the lunge's connection — the scheduler derives
 * that hold live from `windupDur + strikeDur - smackLead` (see useCombatReplay.ts), so the damage always
 * lands on contact however you dial these; the sum is no longer pinned to any fixed value.
