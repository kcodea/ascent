 *  however, draws on the FRONT (viewport) layer while its persistent bulwark lives on the back `tauntFx`
 *  canvas (whose bubble coords are `.app`-relative). The taunt burst is disabled for now, so its viewport rect
 *  (`_tauntRect`) is unused — the param stays so callers + the signature are ready when the burst returns. */
