/**
 * Opponent board source (M3 step 4 — "serve realistic boards"). The enemy board for a wave can be drawn
 * from a pool of real `BoardSnapshot`s (captured player boards / authored boards) instead of the
 * procedural `omen`-minion threat board. `pickOpponent` is deterministic (seeded) and only returns a board
 * when the pool has a strength-matched candidate for the wave; otherwise it returns null and the caller
 * falls back to the procedural threat (`buildEnemyBoard`). So a thin pool degrades gracefully.
 *
 * The pool is a STATIC, versioned dataset — that's deliberate: opponent selection must stay deterministic
 * and replay-faithful (a run re-runs byte-identically), which a live/mutable pool would break. The board
 * library (step 3) grows this dataset (hand it boards in batches; they slot into `OPPONENT_POOL`); the
 * bootstrap entries below are placeholders to be replaced. Async-PvP's live pool (step 5) is a separate,
 * non-deterministic track.
