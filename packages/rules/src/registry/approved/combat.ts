/**
 * APPROVED RULES — domain `combat`.
 *
 * One file per `RuleDomain` so concurrent PRs stop colliding on one tail: a new rule is APPENDED to the end
 * of THIS array (`R-<TOPIC>-<NN>`, ids stable and never recycled, the owner's words as evidence, the
 * regression test as `enforcement.refs` — recipe in CLAUDE.md, "Bug fixes become rules"). The index
 * (`./index.ts`) concatenates every domain file in a fixed order into `APPROVED_RULES`; `approved.test.ts`
 * fails a rule filed under the wrong domain. Never hand-edit the array's shape; never move a rule between
 * files without an owner ruling that its domain changed.
